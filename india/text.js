In  India,  nuclear  energy  development  began  with  the  objectives  of  peaceful  uses  of  atomic  energy  in  improving  
the  quality  of  life  of  the  people  and  to  achieve  self-reliance in meeting the energy needs.

var option2 =`
Nuclear power is the fifth-largest source of electricity in India after coal, gas, hydroelectricity and wind power. As of March 2018, 
India has 22 nuclear reactors in operation in 7 nuclear power plants.
`
var option3 =`
India is committing to reduce the economy’s carbon intensity and increase clean energy capacity. 
Nuclear energy—with its massive potential—will have to play a key role in the country’s future energy mix.

<h2>History of Nuclear Power in India</h2><br>
Shortly after India’s independence in 1947, Dr Homi Bhabha wrote to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, arguing that “within the next couple of decades, 
atomic energy would play an important part in the economy and the industry of countries and that, if India did not wish to fall even further 
behind industrially advanced countries of the world, it would be necessary to develop this branch of science.”
In 1954, Bhabha founded a nuclear research center at Bombay which was later renamed the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC).<br><br>

India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, delivered a speech in 1948 to the General Assembly of India strongly advocating nuclear 
energy. The result was the establishment of the Atomic Energy Commission, and later to the creation of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE). 
The DAE, after developing the first operational research reactor in 1956, then proceeded to construct and complete India's first commercial reactor, 
Tarapur Atomic Power Station, in 1969. From that point, Indian nuclear program has evolved a lot and as of 2018, 3% of electricity in India comes from nuclear.

<h2>Current situation of Nuclear Power in India</h2><br>
Nuclear power is the fifth-largest source of electricity in India after coal, gas, hydroelectricity and wind power. As of March 2018, India has 
22 nuclear reactors in operation in 7 nuclear power plants, with a total installed capacity of 6,780 MW. Nuclear power produced a total of 35 TWh 
and supplied 3.22% of Indian electricity in 2017. The folowing are the seven operational power plants operated by Nuclear Power Corporation of 
India Limited (NPCIL) : <br> <br>

1. Tarapur, Maharashtra <br>
2. Rawatbhata, Rajasthan <br>
3. Kudankulam, Tamil Nadu <br>
4. Kaiga, Karnataka <br>
5. Kakrapar, Gujarat <br>
6. Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu <br>
7. Narora, UP <br>
<br>Seven more reactors are under construction with a combined generation capacity of 4,300 MW.

<h2>Future of Nuclear Power in India</h2><br>
India plans to build 21 new nuclear power reactors - including 10 indigenously designed pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWRs) - 
with a combined generating capacity of 15,700 MWe into operation by 2031, the DAE announced.
<br><br>The most important source of energy for India in the coming decades is nuclear power, given its huge potential for growth, 
emission-free nature and consistent nature of production. A significant expansion of nuclear power can both enable the connectivity 
of millions of Indians who currently lack access to the power grid and help it contribute to global efforts to tackle climate change 
by curbing its total carbon emissions.
<br><br>
The Indian government is committed to growing its nuclear power capacity as part of its infrastructure development programme, and has 
seven units currently under construction. These are: four indigenously designed pressurised heavy water reactors (PWRs), two each at 
Kakrapar and Rajasthan; two Russian-designed VVER PWRs at Kudankulam; and an indigenously designed prototype fast breeder reactor at Kalpakkam.
