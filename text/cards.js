<h1 >History of Nuclear Power</h1>

    <br>The History of Nuclear Energy begins on November 8, 1895 when Wilhelm Röntgen accidently discovers X-rays. 
    Once Röntgen had discovered X-rays, scientists all over Europe began to experiment in the field. 
    Most notable is Becquerel who, in 1896 and 1897 discovered that: Uranium is a strong source of radiation.<br><br>
    
    In 1932 physicist Ernest Rutherford discovered that when lithium atoms were "split" by protons from a proton accelerator, 
    immense amounts of energy were released in accordance with the principle of mass–energy equivalence.<br><br>
    
    In 1934 Enrico Fermi showed that neutrons could split many different types of atoms and yield results lighter than their original reactants.
    This was further developed and  Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman proved that when the atoms are split,
        energy is in turn released; thereby discovering nuclear fission.<br><br>

    Further more, the discovery of chain reaction lead to the creation of the first nuclear reactor in the year 1942, and more and more reactors have
    been built since then.

<h1>How is Nuclear energy generated?</h1>

<br>A nuclear reactor produces electricity in much the same way other power plants do. The chain reaction produces energy in 
    compliance with Mass-Energy Equivalance, which turns water into steam. The pressure of the steam turns a generator, which produces electricity. 
    The difference is in how the heat is created. Power plants that run on fossil fuels burn coal, oil or natural gas to generate heat. 
    In a nuclear energy plant, heat is produced from splitting atoms – a process called nuclear fission<br><br>

    1.) Nuclear reactor creates heat that is used to make steam<br>
    2.) The steam turns a turbine connected to an electromagnet, called a generator<br>
    3.) The generator produces electricity<br><br>

    For more than 60 years, nuclear energy has provided the world with reliable electricity. 
    Today, more than 400 reactors are operating in more than 30 countries. These plants generate around 
    10 percent of the world’s electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. More nations are exploring 
    the use of nuclear energy, particularly as electricity demand increases and concerns about climate change rise.

<h1>Nuclear Fission and Fusion</h1>

    <br>Nuclear fission takes place when a large, somewhat unstable isotope (atoms with the same number of protons but different number of neutrons)
    is bombarded by high-speed particles, usually neutrons. These neutrons are accelerated and then slammed into the unstable isotope, 
    causing it to fission, or break into smaller particles. During the process, a neutron is accelerated and strikes the target nucleus, 
    which in the majority of nuclear power reactors today is Uranium-235. This splits the target nucleus and breaks it down into two smaller 
    isotopes (the fission products), three high-speed neutrons, and a large amount of energy.<br><br>

    The word fusion means "a merging of separate elements into a unified whole". Nuclear fusion refers to the "union of atomic nuclei to form 
    heavier nuclei resulting in the release of enormous amounts of energy". Fusion takes place when 
    two low-mass isotopes, typically isotopes of hydrogen, unite under conditions of extreme pressure and temperature.

<h1>Working of Nuclear Reactors</h1>

<br><h5>There are primarily two types of light-water reactors :</h5> <br>
    <em>Pressurized water reactors</em><br>
    These reactors pump water into the reactor core under high pressure to prevent the water from boiling. The water in the core is heated 
    by nuclear fission and then pumped into tubes inside a heat exchanger. Those tubes heat a separate water source to create steam. The 
    steam then turns an electric generator to produce electricity. The core water cycles back to the reactor to be reheated and the process 
    is repeated.<br><br>
    <em>Boiling water reactors</em><br>
    BWRs heat water and produce steam directly inside the reactor vessel. Water is pumped up through the reactor core and heated by fission. 
    Pipes then feed the steam directly to a turbine to produce electricity. The unused steam is then condensed back to water and reused in 
    the heating process.<br>

<h1>Safety and Hazards</h1>
<br><h5>Nuclear reactors have three unique characteristics that affect their safety, as compared to other power plants :</h5><br> 

    <ul>
    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Firstly, intensely radioactive materials are present in a nuclear reactor. Their release to the environment could be hazardous.<br></li>
    <br>
    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Secondly, the fission products, which make up most of the intensely radioactive substances in the reactor, continue to generate 
    a significant amount of decay heat even after the fission chain reaction has stopped. If the heat cannot be removed from the 
    reactor, the fuel rods may overheat and release radioactive materials.</li>
    <br>
    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Thirdly, a criticality accident (a rapid increase of the reactor power) is possible in certain reactor designs if the chain 
    reaction cannot be controlled. These three characteristics have to be taken into account when designing nuclear reactors.</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Future of Nuclear Energy</h1>
    <br>
    The future of nuclear power varies greatly between countries, depending on government policies. Some countries, most notably, Germany, 
    have adopted policies of nuclear power phase-out. At the same time, some Asian countries, such as China and India, have committed 
    to rapid expansion of nuclear power. Many other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, have policies in between. 
    Japan generated about 30% of its electricity from nuclear power before the Fukushima accident. In 2015 the Japanese government committed to 
    the aim of restarting its fleet of 40 reactors by 2030 after safety upgrades, and to finish the construction of the Generation III Ōma Nuclear 
    Power Plant. This would mean that approximately 20% of electricity would come from nuclear power by 2030. As of 2018, some reactors have 
    restarted commercial operation following inspections and upgrades with new regulations. While South Korea has a large nuclear power 
    industry, the new government in 2017, influenced by a vocal anti-nuclear movement, committed to halting nuclear development after the 
    completion of the facilities presently under construction.
